## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AlzetteLink seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we would greatly appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

To report a vulnerability, please do NOT create a public issue. Instead, please report it via privacy email or by contacting the maintainers directly.

We will do our best to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeframe for a fix. We will keep you informed of our progress.

Thank you for helping keep AlzetteLink safe and secure for everyone.
