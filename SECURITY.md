## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AlzetteLink seriously, especially as it serves as a learning tool for OT/IT convergence.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**. This allows us to assess the risk and patch it before it can be exploited.

### How to Report

1.  **GitHub Private Reporting**: If available, please use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the [Security tab](https://github.com/boubli/AlzetteLink/security).
2.  **Direct Contact**: If private reporting is not available, please contact the maintainers via [Boubli Tech](https://boubli.tech).

### Our Process

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- We will provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
- Once fixed, we will release a patch and acknowledge your contribution (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping make the Industrial IoT community safer!
